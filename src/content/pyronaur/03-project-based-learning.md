I love the idea of multiplying output - doing work in such a way that generates multiple benefits at the same time.

You're embarking on this journey to learn and there are a couple of multipliers we can use to amplify the results you can achieve.

So let's amplify your output!

## Writing

Writing is one of those multipliers that's got even more multipliers built-in.

#### Repetition

Repetition is the mother of all learning.

Writing things down, you'll not only learn by reading/watching, but also by repeating in your own words. 

#### Reference

Build the reference material you wish you had. Found a good tutorial? Add that to your list of useful links. Building lists of links has become its own thing on GitHub, - [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

Especially in the world of development - there's so much to learn that I constantly forget what I learned weeks ago, and so I have to re-learn. 

It's a natural part of the work, and so - you can go in prepared. Make notes - your blog posts are your notes. Make them detailed and well organized so that you can find what you need later.

#### Help Others

The challenges you're facing today are going to be the challenges of the past in a month. You'll learn, and what seemed daunting or confusing is going to become second nature to you.

The things you're learning right now are going to be novel to you only for a limited amount of time until you get used to them. If you write down - you can help others who are inevitably going to be on the same path as you are. What you write may still be relevant to someone 5 years from now.

Maybe it's the information that they'll find, maybe it's encouragement, maybe both. Whatever it is that you feel lacking - write about it. 

Explore, dive deep, and then write it down.

#### Deeper thoughts

I find that whenever I write, I think things through more thoroughly. So if it's an idea - I challenge that idea more thoroughly. If it's a tutorial, I double and triple-check the various pieces to make sure I'm not spreading misinformation. All this leads to better content and much deeper learning than otherwise.



## Project based learning

In addition to writing, there's yet another multiplier that we can use - and that's project-based learning.

Project-based learning means that we're going to jump into building projects a lot sooner than you might feel comfortable with. If at any point you feel like you're in way over your head - that's a good sign, it means that you're learning.

Learning this way is going to make learning a lot more fun, you'll get to work on real projects and learn a lot more than just writing code.


## Next Steps

* Complete the [JavaScript for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg) course.
* If you prefer reading, I recommend you go through [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
* As you go through each of the tutorial sections, like `if` statements or `functions` - try to lean into the things you don't understand. At the very least - write down your questions - write down what's difficult. That's going to be really valuable information in the future.
* If you're up for it - sign up to [JavaScript30.com](https://javascript30.com/) and follow along with a video tutorial there. If those tutorials are a bit too much right now - that's ok. Make a note and we can return to those later on.

Just keep swimming.

Variables, statements, functions, types, etc. All those are necessary building blocks of any programming language, and always be thinking - how can you make this more fun.

Can you write a tutorial about variables and functions that's a lot more fun than the resources available to you? If so - how?


## Writing Prompts

* "What's in their head?". What are some of the most popular websites you use? Have you looked at their source code? What's in their head tags? Any common themes? Write about the common tags within the head of the sites you use. Any interesting results?
* A JavaScript tutorial for absolute beginners - what is a variable? What's the difference between `var`, `let` and `const`?
