Developers use a lot of tools to build even more tools. So one key skill you'll have to learn - is how to find and examine the information you need and then learn quickly.

And just like with most things in life - there's only one way to get better at it - by doing it.

But - there's a way to accelerate that process, and that's by teaching.

So you're going to become the teacher. This blog is going to be your teaching platform. I'm just here to help set a direction for you.

I can already hear a protest:

> What? Me? Teach? I don't know anything.

And to that I say - you didn't know *anything* last week. But then yesterday you went through 3 courses and learned about GitHub, Markdown, and HTML.

Those are 3 topics that any beginner is going to have to go through. So write up a post that shows a complete beginner how to re-create [your first site](https://pat125.github.io/intro-html/).

## The Blog

I've created a [directory for you](https://github.com/pyronaur/codenamebrother.com/tree/main/src/content/pat125).

The content in there has to be formatted as `Frontmatter`. Frontmatter is an addition to Markdown so that we can add information about the Markdown file that can be used elsewhere, in this case - in the blogging system.

I've [created a draft](https://github.com/pyronaur/codenamebrother.com/blob/60adf79f7e4c467c6216b3ca519b5050f3115e01/src/content/pat125/drafts/01-starting-out.md) so that you can get going:

```md
---
title: Hello, world!
date: 2022-04-07
preview: Hello world!
---	

You'll add some text here as well ðŸ˜‰
```

The `title` is going to become the blog post title. `preview` is going to show up when a list of posts is displayed, and you should update the `date` to whatever is the date of publishing.


Alright - time for you to get to writing!

## How to write

You could edit the file directly on GitHub, but since you'll be working on the site - more and more, I think it makes sense to just clone the repository to your machine.

You can use the [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone the repository, and then [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the files.

And remember, as soon as something feels complicated - that's an idea for another tutorial!
