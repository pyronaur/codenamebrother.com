Before we get going, we need to get you up to speed on a couple of things that are going to help with everything else:

## GitHub

https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github

GitHub is the most important platform for developers. It's where developers share, view, store, and backup code. These days code is also usually "deployed" from GitHub (we can talk about deploying later).

In any case - GitHub is the place you want to be as a developer, no matter which language, framework, or what your goal is.

It's mandatory learning at this point ðŸ™‚

## Markdown

Markdown is how developers communicate. You can't just have plain text everywhere, you need headings, bold text, links, etc. That's what Markdown is used for.

You don't need to memorize anything, that'll happen over the years.

For now - you just need exposure - get a feel for what's possible.

## HTML

https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html

Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) (*Nobody calls it "Hyper ...." anything.*) It's always referred to as "HTML". It powers the web. 

HTML is what enables you to group text, pictures, styles, and scripts in a way that your browser (Chrome, Firefox) understands.

Markdown is actually usually (not always) converted to HTML.

I'm excited! This is going to be fun ðŸ˜Š
